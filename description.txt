List view
----------
To view a list of objects, you would send a GET request to:
https://docstoreapp.herokuapp.com/list

It has one mandatory parameter, "data_type", which specifies whether
to search for 'folders', 'docs', or 'topics'.
The following optional parameters are available for each data type
	folder
		name - finds folder w/ given name
		topics - finds folder w/ given list of topics
	docs
		name - finds document(s) w/ given name TODO: Test case, duplicate names across folders
		topics - finds document(s) that have a topic within this given list of topics
		folder - specifies folder to look for documents in
	topic
		name - finds topics w/ given short form descriptor
		desc - finds topics w/ a given substring in its long form descriptor

Example:
To search for all documents with the 'fruit' or 'legumes' tag,
https://docstoreapp.herokuapp.com/list?data_type=docs&topics="fruit,legumes"

Create view
-----------
To create an object you would send a POST request to
https://docstoreapp.herokuapp.com/create/

The parameters are the same as for the list view, except that 'docs' have an additional argument
'file' that specifies the document to upload and the topics should have both short and long-form
descriptors specified.

Example:
To create a folder named 'Beverages' with the tag 'drinks', the following would be passed as data
in JSON format
{
	'data_type' : 'folders'
	'name' : 'Beverages',
	'tags' : [
		'name' : 'drinks',
		'name' : 'Drinks'
	]
}


Update view
------------
To update an object you would send a PUT request to 
https://docstoreapp.herokuapp.com/update/

The parameters are also the same as for the Create view, except
that the 'key' for the object must be specified.

Example:
Since a folder's name is also it's key, to update the topics list for a folder
named 'Snacks' to 'junk' the data in the request would be
{
	'data_type' : 'folders',
	'key' : 'Snacks',
	'topics' : [
		{
			'name' : 'junk',
			'desc' : 'Junk Food',
		}
	]
}


Delete view
-----------
To delete an object you would send a DELETE request to
https://docstoreapp.herokuapp.com/delete/

The required parameters are the 'data_type' and the 'key'

Example:
To delete a document with the key 5, the data in the request would be
{
	'data_type' : 'docs',
	'key' : 5
}
